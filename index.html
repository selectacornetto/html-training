        <h2>Why Am I Studying HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            You might be wondering: <i>Why on Earth am I studying a STEM field, let alone web development, when I originally studied
            and graduated from a liberal arts degree program?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, my friend, I'm tired of writing. I'm done with its tedium and routine. I'm tied of creating something and having zero semblance of what
            happens to it after I submit the draft. Instead, I want to learn something else and create products that <b>I can be proud of</b>. I want my
            work to be visible from start to finish. I want to be able to design something, plan it, create it, and see it through until it reaches the
            end user.
        </p>
            <h3>
                My End Goal
            </h3>
            <p>
                I'm unsure what one would call the profession that I want to become. More specifically, I want to manage websites, and by "manage," I mean
                I want to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Create the website, front- to back-end</li>
                        <li>Design its UI and UX</li>
                        <li>Maintain the entire website and its databases, including cybersecurity</li>
                        <li>Create, edit, and manage its content</li>
                        <li>Handle SEO, advertising, and other marketing matters</li>
                    </ul>
                It might sound too ambitions. Heck, it' might even be something that isn't fit for <i>one</i>. I understand that. However, what I mean by this
                is I want the knowlegdeâ€”even <b>just</b> the knowledge, to be able to do these things. As a result, I can become an all-around professional that
                companies would actively seek and find indispensable.
             </p>
             <p>
                That would personally be rewarding. The journey would involve learning a lot of skills and information, which I already love doing. Since I now
                have experience with web content creation and SEO, I believe web development is the right step toward my goal. I'll be progressing my studies in
                this field while I continue to advance my current writing and SEO career.
             </p>
             <p>
                It's gonna be fun!
             </p>
